## ❗ Info

**GAME UPDATED, SO WAIT FOR THE UPDATE MADAFAKAR**

Free external cheat for CS2, written in C++.

Discord server: [ＡＬ   Ｅ－ＳＰＯＲＴＳ](https://discord.com/invite/MM5BECEaJR)

Most of the code is contributed by some special users, and the code structure might be very messy. If you try to download and understand the code, you will find a lot of **shitty** logic




## ⚠️ Notice


> I am so busy that I may not update the code on time. If u have the capability to update or fix bugs, u can pull ur request in my discord server🤩
